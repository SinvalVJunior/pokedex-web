## Notes
- The principal idea of this project is to play a roullete game to select a random pokemon and add the pokemon to the user's inventory where he will see it's stats. We will use PokeAPI to get the user's selected pokemon and a rest backend application to store then. The application uses the react freamwork to animate the roullete and show the stats to the user.

- Currently there is only one user in the database. The user is: email: admin@admin password: admin
- The current available pages are:
-- Login 
-- Register 
-- Edit user 
-- Play
-- Inventory
