## Notes
- The principal idea of this project is to play a roullete game to select a random pokemon and add the pokemon to the user's inventory where he will see it's stats. We will use PokeAPI to get the user's selected pokemon and a rest backend application to store then. The application uses the react freamwork to animate the roullete and show the stats to the user.

- There's no user validation to login. Just type a valid email and any password and it will enter the app.
